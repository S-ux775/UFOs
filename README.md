** Overview of Project: 

Tnis project consist of creating an interactive page that displyas information about UFO sightings based on user's choice. 

The data is stored in a JavaScrpt file data.js and contained information about the date, city, state, country, shape of UFO occurrence and a brief description of it. The structure of the page is hosted in an HTML code, data.js, Bootstrap and CSS for added customization.

** Results: 
The output result based on search criteria is immediartely shown without the need of pressing or selecting a button. This last resouce was an improvement from the original set up.

** Summary:

A drawback for this model is that we are dealing with stored data (i.e. no real time data). For further development we may consider more filter options to better get the data we are looking for.
